# Installation

The project is based on NodeJs, Express and MongoDB. You need to make sure that you have compatible versions of node/yarn, npm and mongoDB installed. CSS is used as the stylesheet here.

## Initial Setup

Clone the repository

## Local Development Setup

You will need to have npm CLI installed into your system

Cd into the project
`cd HackOverFlow 4.0`

Install All Dependencies
`npm install`

Replace the mongoDB URI on app.js to your database link

or, run the following command to run local mongo server
`mongod`

Serve the Project on localhost
`npm start`

Your site must be visible at
`http://localhost:3000`
